# PCB_design_8051_proteus_autocad

The 8051 microcontroller is an 8-bit microcontroller architecture that was developed by Intel in the 1980s. It quickly gained popularity and became one of the most widely used microcontrollers in the industry. The "8051" name comes from the original chip, the Intel 8051.

The 8051 microcontroller is based on a Harvard architecture, which means it has separate program and data memory spaces. It features a compact instruction set of 111 instructions, making it relatively easy to program and work with.

I designed a 8051 based testing board using proteus software.In this repo I attached the following files related to my work
